# TODO

- Run grid search to tune base_weights once Python environment is available:

- Evaluation matrix (baseline metrics snapshot):
  - Archive AUC/Brier/acc results for comparison in future iterations.

- Frontend UX polish:

- Functional verification checklist:
  - Check JSON serialization and date fields remain stable.
  - Validate UI rendering for downward levels across dark/light themes and small screens.
